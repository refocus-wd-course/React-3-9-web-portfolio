            <p>
                Nikola Tesla had a remarkable career as an electrical engineer
                and inventor. He began his career working for the Continental
                Edison Company in France, where he designed dynamos and motors.
                He then moved to the United States and worked for the inventor
                Thomas Edison, where he helped develop the Edison Machine Works.

                <br />
                After parting ways with Edison, Tesla formed his own company and
                focused on developing alternating current (AC) electrical
                systems, which became the basis for modern power systems. He
                also invented numerous devices and technologies, including the
                Tesla coil, the Tesla turbine, and the wireless transmission of
                electrical energy.

                Throughout his career, Tesla was known for his innovative ideas,
                his attention to detail, and his ability to solve complex
                problems. He was a prolific inventor, with over 300 patents to
                his name. Despite facing financial and personal challenges, he
                continued to work tirelessly to advance science and technology
                until his death in 1943. Today, he is widely regarded as one of
                the most important inventors and engineers in history.
